# 12-degraded-events-empty

## Intent

Simulate low-signal triage where warning events may be absent or unhelpful.

## Expected behavior

- Report keeps the 8 required sections.
- Engine states insufficient evidence when only low-value signals are available.
- Next best diagnostic requests minimum additional data explicitly.
