# 16-degraded-api-timeout

## Intent

Simulate partial API/diagnostic failure surfaces where endpoint data is not sufficient.

## Expected behavior

- Engine reports insufficient evidence instead of speculative fixes.
- Next best diagnostic requests one minimal, high-value follow-up action.
- Action budget remains enforced.
